You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

SOLUTION:-
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        int ans=0;
        map<char,int>mpp;
        for(int i=0;i<jewels.length();i++){
            mpp[jewels[i]]++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<stones.length();i++){
            if(mpp.find(stones[i])!=mpp.end()){
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

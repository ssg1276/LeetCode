Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

SOLUTIONS:-
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int low=0;
        int mid=0;
        int high=n-1;
        while(mid<=high){
            if(nums[mid]==0){
                   swap(nums[low],nums[mid]);
                   low++;
                   mid++;
            }
            else if(nums[mid]==1){
                mid++;

            }
            else {
                swap(nums[high],nums[mid]);
                high--;

            }
        }
    }
};

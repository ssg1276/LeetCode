Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

SOLUTION:-
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int n1=s.length();
        int n2=t.length();
        int i=0,j=0;
        while(i<n1 && j<n2){
            if(s[i]==t[j]){
                i++;
            }
            j++;
                
        
        }
        return i==n1?true:false;
    }
};
